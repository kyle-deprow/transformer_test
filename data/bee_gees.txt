Where are you (where are you)
Night is day and day is night
Where are you (where are you)
Need you girl you're not in sight
Our love would grow, but you leave and I know
That you don't love me (where are you)
I need you girl, you're not in sight
I told you (I told you)
I was never coming back -ah
You told me (You told me)
You would give my love the sack -ah
Now as I fly, you won't tell me goodbye
'Cause you don't love me (where are you)

Now you give my love the sack -ah
Now as my heart lies in pieces of eight
You were a part of my love but too late
I love you (I love you)
This I think that you should know
I'll be blue (I'll be blue)
You are still 'cause I must
I'd like to stay but I know you won't play
And see things my way (where are you)
You are still 'cause I must go
You are still 'cause I must
I must go (where are you )


Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead

Where is the light
That would play
In my streets
And where are the friends
I could meet
I could meet

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where is the girl I loved
All along
The girl that I loved
She's gone
She's gone

All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away

Everybody
Spicks and specks
Spicks and specks, yeah, ah
(Ah) spicks and specks
Spicks and specks

I'm a fool, I've taken no advice
And I'm so cruel, I'm talkin' to you nice
But then again you may not take me back
Oh just to put my hat back on your rack
Guess I don't know why I bother with myself
You will find a part of me in someone else
I never argued with the fact that she is mine
I only hurt her and kissed her three times out of nine
You have the edge to talk to men and make them feel at home
You spent that every lasting cent on someone that's not your own
Bear with me there's bound to be a chance
To heal the wound and start back our romance
I gained a heart and part of it is yours
Oh just to see my love walk through these doors
Oh and my life's bound out ahead, I can not look
And if you read me, then I am just a book
You don't care if rain falls in my room
You won't be there if trouble fills my spoon
I'm just a clown that plays around with misery in my way
Forgetting all the rules of love ....[fade]


When I was just a little boy, when I didn't know
My daddy put me on his knee and showed me the way to go
He said, "A woman will do her best to make a fool out of you
So be a man and stand the test and see what you can do."

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

If you got what it takes my boy
You can always choose
Work it out before it's too late my boy
Make sure you never lose

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

Born a man

Ev'ry woman wants her man to live and learn on her land
Where I go, baby you go
Arrangement, man and wife

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

Born a man

Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles
She likes to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle

We used to cry on each other's shoulder
Now that I'm older, she wanders ahead
Now that she's found love, I still hear the sound of
Silvery bangles, remain in my head

Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles
She used to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle

Mm..... [fade]


I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm goin' crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through
How many times must I tell you I love
Tell you I love you times before
Don't believe that I'm worth all your kisses
I'm worth more than this, but you ignore

How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take 'til I get you
I will be crying, yeah

Maybe tomorrow you'll come walkin' my way
Come talkin' my way, you'll find out
My love for you will be stronger than truer
I'll look at you and there's no doubt

How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take 'til I get you
I will be crying, yeah

I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm going crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through
Baby, baby, baby

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around
Since I was born
And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
Oh, when you walk
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
You know it's alright, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive (oh)
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive (oh)
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive (hey)
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah (ah, ah, ah)
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah (ah, ah, ah, ay)
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah (oh)
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
